// need to:
//  - load existing profiles from the directory
//  - save profiles back to the directory


// TODO use https://pub.dev/packages/watcher (already added) to:
//  - watch the directory storing profiles for changes
// - maybe some way to watch for an external drive to be plugged in and then import profiles from there?
